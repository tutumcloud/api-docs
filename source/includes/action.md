An action represents an API call by a user. Details of the API call such as timestamp, origin IP address, and user agent are logged in the action object.

Simple API calls that do not require asynchronous execution will return immediately with the appropiate HTTP error code and an action object will be created either in `Success` or `Failed` states. API calls that do require asynchronous execution will return HTTP code `202 Accepted` immediately and create an action object in `In progress` state, which will change to `Success` or `Failed` state depending on the outcome of the operation being performed.
